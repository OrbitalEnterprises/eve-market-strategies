# Preface

EVE Online is unique among online games in that the in-game market has significant importance to players, regardless of the game play style they choose to pursue. Whether in high, low or null security, many \(probably all\) players rely on EVE’s markets to buy and equip ships, sell acquired or produced goods, buy supplies needed for various endeavors, and otherwise fill gaps in the set of things needed to pursue various play styles.

As the market has long been an important feature of EVE, some players have similarly focused on developing tools and strategies to support the use of markets. In the early days, these tools were intended to supplement standard play styles, for example making it easier to track market participation \(e.g. positions, open orders\) as part of a larger strategy \(e.g. mining, production, conquest\). However, as the game has grown, so has the sophistication of the markets, and in modern EVE “playing the markets” is a valid play style pursued by many players.  Third party tool developers have adopted to these changes as well, with many new tools written explicitly to support profiting from the market.  CCP, for their part, has responded by providing more real-time data \(e.g. five minute market snapshots\), and more visibility into alternative markets \(e.g. citadel markets\). The combination of new tools and rich data has made it possible to implement many “real life” trading strategies that were previously difficult to execute[^1].

This book attempts to be a systematic discussion of data driven analysis and trading strategies in EVE's markets.  The strategies we derive here rely on public data provided by CCP.  Not all of this data is market data and, in fact, more complicated strategies often rely on non-market data. Regardless, all of this data is publicly available: the strategies we describe here don’t rely on non-public or otherwise proprietary data.  We derive concepts and strategies using publicly available tools, and we share our techniques through a number of examples \(including source code\).  While the example code we present here is suitable for illustrative purposes, serious market players will likely want to write custom, optimized code for certain strategies \(as the author does\).

## Summary of Chapters

The remainder of the book is organized as follows:

* [Chapter 1 - Preliminaries](#preliminaries)
  This chapters describes key features of the EVE markets and introduces tools and data sources used to describe trading strategies.  This chapter concludes with several examples introducing the tools.
* [Chapter 2 - Arbitrage](#arbitrage)
  This chapter describes arbitrage trading which is the process of discovering undervalued market items which can be purchased and turned into profit very quickly.
* [Chapter 3 - Market Making](#market-making)
  This chapter describes market making strategies, better known as station trading, which profits from market participants willing to "cross the spread" instead of waiting for better prices through limit orders.

## Change Log

* 2017-02-12: Beyond the initial three chapters, we have three additional chapters planned:
  * "Simulating Trading Strategies" - eventually this will describe a simple back test simulator we're developing.
  * "Risk" - this chapter will give a more careful treatment to risk around trading \(and EVE in general\).
  * "Trend Trading" - this chapter will discuss trend-based trading strategies.

[^1]: I'm not claiming CCP intended to enable specific trading strategies, only that the data available now makes this possible.

# Preliminaries

This chapter explains the mechanics of EVE markets and introduces the various sources of market data we use to develop trading strategies.  We also introduce the tools we'll use in the rest of the book to develop our strategies.  We end the chapter with several examples illustrating these tools.

## Market Structure

EVE markets are governed by a set of rules which define how orders are placed, how they are matched, and what charges are imposed on the participants in a trade.  Market structure in EVE is somewhat unique, but if comparisons to actual financial markets must be made, then EVE markets are most similar to a commodities spot market.  Commodities markets trade physical assets \(or rather, the right of ownership of assets\), much the same as trading occurs in EVE markets.  A "spot market" is a market in which assets are exchanged at current prices, as opposed to prices guaranteed by a contract \(e.g. futures markets\).

Many good descriptions of EVE markets are already available on the web.  We recommend reading EVE University's [Trading Introduction](http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Trading) for a thorough overview of the interface, important skills and basic mechanics.  Rather than recount that description here, we instead provide a more academic treatment of some key aspects of EVE markets below.

### Order Mechanics

There are two order types in EVE markets:

* A *market order* is an instruction to buy or sell an asset at the current best available price.
* A *limit order* is an instruction to buy or sell an asset at a fixed price, which may be different than the current best available price.

Although this terminology is standard in financial literature, the EVE UI does not use these terms in order placement screens.  Generally speaking, if you are placing an order using the "advanced" UI screen \(with a duration other than "immediate"\), then you are placing a limit order.  Otherwise, you are placing a market order.  This is true even if your limit order is matched immediately, and has important consequences in terms of trading cost \(see below\).

Orders are handled "First In, First Out" \(FIFO\), meaning the sequence of order arrival determines priority for matching with other orders.  When a sell order is placed, the items being sold are placed in escrow at the seller's location.  If a sell order is filled, then the sold items are moved to the buyer's hangar at the seller's location.  In other words, all transactions occur at the seller's location.  This has at least two important consequences for trading strategies:

1. If the buyer is not in the same station as the seller, then the buyer may need to transport purchased goods elsewhere; and,
2. If the seller is in a player-owned structure which is not accessible to the buyer \(e.g. access controls are changed after the sale\), then the buyer's assets may become stranded.

Market participation from player-owned structures is a relatively recent feature \(at time of writing\).  However, the number of such participants is growing, making it important to consider access risk when buying goods from sellers in these structures.[^2]

### Price Formation

Trade prices in EVE markets are determined by order matching rules.  Unlike other financial markets, there is no facility for price negotiation or auction, although some of these features exist in secondary markets \(e.g. the contract system\).  Sell orders in EVE have a location, price, quantity and minimum volume.  Buy orders have a location, price, quantity, minimum volume and range.  A pair of orders match when:

1. The location of the sell order is within range of the location specified in the buy order.
2. The sell order represents the first, lowest priced sell order within range of the buy order.
3. The buy order represents the first, highest priced buy order within range of the sell order.
4. A price exists which meets the pricing constraints \(see below\).

The price at which the transaction occurs must satisfy the following constraints:

1. A sell limit order must match at or above the posted price on the order.
2. A buy limit order must match at or below the posted price on the order.
3. A buy or sell market order must match at the posted price on the order.
4. If the sell order has precedence \(arrived at the market first\), then the transaction price is the maximum price which satisfies the above constraints.
5. If the buy order has precedence, then the transaction price is the minimum price which satisfies the above constraints.

The effect of precedence rules means that some care must be taken when pricing orders.  For example, suppose a sell limit order is placed for 100 ISK.  Suppose further that this order is currently the best available sale price \(i.e. the first, lowest price available in the current location\).  If a buy limit order is then placed for 101 ISK, then this order will match immediately at a price of 101 ISK \(*not* 100 ISK\) because the sell order has precedence.  A similar behavior occurs when buy limit orders have precedence.

### Transaction Costs

EVE markets impose two fees on orders:

* *Broker Fees* are charged at order placement time for all limit orders \(even orders which match immediately\).  The owner of the order is charged this fee.
* *Sales Tax* is charged each time a sell order is matched and is paid by the seller.

Broker fees are charged as a percentage of the total order value, with the charge normally between 2.5% and 5% \(adjusted by standing and the Broker Relations skill\).  Sales tax is charged as a percentage of the matched order volume multiplied by the match price, with the charge normally between 1% and 2% \(adjusted by the Accounting Skill\).  Sales tax in player-owned structures is determined by the owner and may be lower than the normal range.

There are two important consequences of this fee structure:

1. Market buy orders incur no fees.  Thus, it can sometimes be advantageous to simply wait for a good price instead of placing a limit buy order \(which will incur a broker fee\); and,
2. The fees determine the minimum return required for a profitable strategy.  For example, a typical market making strategy which uses limit orders on both the buy and sell side will need to return at least 6% to be profitable \(5% paid on both sides for limit orders, plus 1% sales tax on transactions\).

Training Broker Relations and Accounting skills is usually mandatory for serious EVE market players as these skills at max training reduce fees by a significant amount.

### Information Disclosure

The primary live source of information for EVE markets is the game client UI which shows a live view of the current order book for each asset, as well as historical pricing information.  CCP provides third party developer APIs which expose similar information \(see below\), but the game client is always the most up to date view of the markets.  Several important metrics are visible from the game client including the volume \(total assets traded\) to date, and the current spread \(difference between best buy price and best sell price\) between buyers and sellers.  The order book for a given asset displays price, volume and location for each order, but does *not* display the names of market participants.  However, the names of market participants *are* recorded and visible to each counterparty when a transaction is completed.  This is a unique feature of EVE markets which is quite different from other financial markets where anonymity is preserved between counterparties.[^3]  This feature also provides an opportunity for traders to gather more information about other market participants, for example by buying or selling in small quantities to competing bids in order to discover the names of competitors.

Recent EVE expansions have added the ability to create market hubs in player-owned structures.  These hubs are added to the market for the region they are located in, allowing orders to be placed from player-owned locations.  Although market hubs are now included in regional markets, the player-owned structure itself may not be publicly accessible, or accessibility may change during the course of a day's market events.  As a result:

* Sell orders may appear from player-owned structures, but sold items may be inaccessible if a structure changes access after the transaction completes; and,
* Buy orders may appear from non-public player-owned structures.  The location of these structures is visible in game, but is currently *not* visible in data out of game \(e.g. third party APIs\).

It is generally safe to sell to orders placed from player-owned structures.  However, great care should be taken when buying from orders placed from player-owned structures.  Missing location information in out of game data sources is mostly an annoyance right now as workarounds exist to obtain the needed information.

### Contract System

EVE has a large secondary market called the "contract system" which allows for direct player to player exchange of numerous assets, including assets which are not tradable on EVE markets \(e.g. fitted ships\).  We don't cover the contract system is this book, mainly because there is currently no reliable third party API to gather information about available contracts.

## Market Data

As noted above, market data is visible in the game client in two separate views:

1. A view of the current order book for an asset in a region; and
2. A view of the daily high, low, and average trade prices \(and related metrics\), and total volume for an asset as far back as one year.

The game client always shows the most recent view of market data.  All other data sources \(e.g. third party developer sources\) lag the game client.  It's also worth noting that the game client is the only EULA-approved way to participate in the market by buying or selling assets.[^4]

Data driven development of trading strategies is usually conducted offline, preferably using several years of market data.  CCP has only recently invested effort in making market data easily accessible to third party developers.  Historically, market data was gathered through crowd sourcing efforts by scraping cached data stored in the game client.[^5]  Scraped data was then aggregated and made available by third party sites like [EVE Central](https://eve-central.com/).  Asset coverage relied on having enough players interested in regularly viewing certain assets \(so that the client cache would be refreshed regularly\).  The fact that players themselves were providing data also raised concerns about purposely modifying data to affect game play.  Despite these limitations and risks, crowd sourced data was the primary source of market data for many years.  

In 2015, CCP started providing market history, order book, and market pricing data through their ["CREST" API](https://eveonline-third-party-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/crest/index.html).  CREST is a REST-based web API which supports both public and authorized data endpoints.  Authorized endpoints use the [EVE Single Sign-On](https://eveonline-third-party-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sso/index.html) service based on OAuth access control.  CREST authorization is only used for certain player or corporation related endpoints.  Market data can be accessed on CREST without authentication.  When market modules were released for player-owned structures \(e.g. Citadels\), public buy orders placed in these modules were eventually made visible in CREST market data.  However, CREST provided no mechanism for resolving the location where these player-owned structures resided, making it difficult to implement the same order matching rules as provided in the game client.

While CREST was an important upgrade for third party developers \(as compared to the [XML API](https://eveonline-third-party-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/xmlapi/index.html)\), CCP significantly modernized third party APIs by releasing the [EVE Swagger Interface \(ESI\)](https://esi.tech.ccp.is/latest/) which exposed a new REST-based web API documented with [Swagger](http://swagger.io/).  Swagger documentation allows the use of many convenient tools for third party developers, such as API browsers and client generators in a variety of languages.  Swagger also provides clean support for versioning and authorization, making it much easier for CCP to evolve the API over time.  The ESI provides the same market data as in CREST with two important upgrades:

1. A facility for resolving the location of certain player-owned structures; and,
2. Access to order book data local to player-owned structures.

The ESI uses the same OAuth based authorization scheme as CREST.  At time of writing, CCP has declared ESI as the API of the future and has deprecate both CREST and the XML API.  However, CCP has stated they will keep the XML API and CREST active at least until ESI reaches feature parity.  Unless otherwise indicated, examples in this book which require direct access to live market data will use the ESI endpoints.

The remainder of this section describes the main market data ESI endpoints in more detail.  

### Market History Endpoints

The market history endpoint returns a daily price summary for a given asset type in a given region.  In financial modeling terms, this data is similar to daily stock market data.  The market history endpoint returns all data from the start of the previous calendar year.

We'll use market history to demonstrate the use of the ESI.  ESI endpoints follow REST conventions and can always be accessed using the HTTP protocol.  For example, the following URL will return market history for Tritanium \(type 34\) in Forge \(region 10000002\):

```
https://esi.tech.ccp.is/latest/markets/10000002/history/?datasource=tranquility&type_id=34
```

The result of this request will be a JSON formatted array of values of the form:

```json
{
  "date": "2015-05-01",
  "average": 5.25,
  "highest": 5.27,
  "lowest": 5.11,
  "order_count": 2267,
  "volume": 16276782035
}
```

where:

* *date* - gives the date for which the values are reported.
* *average* - gives the average trade price of the asset for the day.
* *highest* - gives the highest trade price of the asset for the day.
* *lowest* - gives the lowest trade price of the asset for the day.
* *order_count* - gives the number of trades for the day.
* *volume* - gives the number of units traded for the day.

What makes the ESI special is the Swagger definition which can be retrieved at:

```
https://esi.tech.ccp.is/latest/swagger.json?datasource=tranquility
```

The Swagger definition is a structured description of the endpoints of ESI, including the name and type of the arguments required, the format of the result, and any authorization that may be required.  Tools make use of this definition to automatically generate documentation and API clients.  For example, the documentation of the above endpoint can be found [here](https://esi.tech.ccp.is/latest/#!/Market/get_markets_region_id_history).

In addition to the response body, the ESI also returns several important HTTP response headers.  There are three headers you should observe:

* *date* - this is the date at the server when the result was generated.  All dates are normally UTC \(i.e. "EVE" time\).
* *last-modified* - this is the date the response body was last changed.  The difference between *date* and *last-modified* gives the age of the data.
* *expires* - this is the date when the current response body should be refreshed.  It will be unproductive to request the data again before this time.

The *expires* field is important for automated collection of data, and for competitive analysis.  The tools we describe later in this chapter use *expires* to drive regular downloads of the data for historical analysis.  The *expires* field also tells you how frequently other market participants can see fresh data \(unless they are using the game client\).

### Order Book Data Endpoints

The market order book endpoints return a view of the current orders for a given region, optionally restricted to a given type.  The ESI endpoint to retrieve this data is ["get market region orders"](https://esi.tech.ccp.is/latest/#!/Market/get_markets_region_id_orders).  The following URL will retrieve the first page of orders for Tritanium \(type 34\) in Forge \(region 10000002\):

```
https://esi.tech.ccp.is/latest/markets/10000002/orders/?datasource=tranquility&order_type=all&page=1&type_id=34
```

Leaving off `type_id=34` will return all orders for all types in the given region.  The result of this request will be a JSON formatted array of values of the form:

```json
{
  "order_id": 4740968511,
  "type_id": 34,
  "location_id": 60005599,
  "volume_total": 1296000,
  "volume_remain": 952089,
  "min_volume": 1,
  "price": 10,
  "is_buy_order": false,
  "duration": 90,
  "issued": "2017-01-06T22:29:36Z",
  "range": "region"
}
```

where:

* *order_id* - gives the unique order id for this order.
* *type_id* - gives the type of asset transacted by this order.
* *location_id* - gives the location where this order was placed.  The location is important for computing possible order matches and is discussed in more detail below.
* *volume_total* - gives the total number of assets to be transacted when the order was placed.
* *volume_remain* - gives the number of assets still left to be transacted for this order.
* *min_volume* - gives the minimum number of assets which must be exchanged each time this order is matched.  Note that "volume\_remain" can be less than "min\_volume", in which case fewer assets may transact on the last match for the order.
* *price* - is the posted priced for the order.
* *is_buy_order* - is true if the order is a "bid" \(buy\), otherwise the order is an "ask" \(sell\).
* *duration* - is the length of time in days that the order will remain in the book until it is matched.
* *issued* - is the issue date of the order.
* *range* - only applies to bids and is the maximum distance from the origin station that an ask will be allowed to match.

Order book data is the most current out of game view of the markets and is therefore very important data for many traders.  Some important properties about order book data:

* At time of writing, order book data is refreshed every five minutes.  That is, your view of market data may be up to five minutes old.  You can refer to the *expires* response header to determine when the order book will be refreshed.
* Order book data for most active regions can not be returned in a single API call \(unless filtering for a single type\).  Instead, book data is "paged" across multiple calls.  The requested page is controlled by the "page" argument as shown in the URL above.  The ESI does not report how many total pages are available.  The normal solution is to continue to retrieve pages until a page is returned containing less than 10000 orders.  This indicates the last page available for the query.  The "page" argument is ignored for requests filtered by type.
* Order book data may include orders from player-owned structures, some of which may be non-public.  Orders from non-public structures cause problems for out of game analysis because the ESI currently provides no way to discover the location of these structures.  Crowd sourced data can be used in these cases \(see [Example 3 - Trading Rules: Build an Order Matching Algorithm](#example-3---trading-rules-build-an-order-matching-algorithm) below\).

Order book data can also be requested directly from player-owned structures.  This is done using the ["get markets structures"](https://esi.tech.ccp.is/latest/#!/Market/get_markets_structures_structure_id) endpoint.  Some player-owned markets are not public, despite their buy orders appearing the regional market, but for those that allow access, the format of the results is identical to the format returned by the ["get market region orders"](https://esi.tech.ccp.is/latest/#!/Market/get_markets_region_id_orders) endpoint.

### Pricing Data Endpoints

Certain industrial calculations, such as reprocessing tax, require reference price data computed by CCP on a daily basis.  This data is available to third party developers using the ["get market prices"](https://esi.tech.ccp.is/latest/#!/Market/get_markets_prices) endpoint.  A request to this endpoint will return an array of price data in this format:

```json
{
  "type_id": 32772,
  "average_price": 501374.49,
  "adjusted_price": 502330.89
}
```

where:

* *type_id* - gives the asset type.
* *average_price* - gives a rolling average price[^6].
* *adjusted_price* - gives a formulaic price which is used as a reference price in several calculations.  The formula by which this price is computed is not publicly documented.

We document this endpoint because some strategies discussed in later chapters need to compute certain industrial formulas.

### Structure Location Endpoints

The last market data endpoint we document is the ["get universe structure id"](https://esi.tech.ccp.is/latest/#!/Universe/get_universe_structures_structure_id) endpoint.  This is an authenticated endpoint which provides player-owned structure information in the format:

```json
{
  "name": "V-3YG7 VI - The Capital",
  "solar_system_id": 30000142
}
```

where:

* *name* - gives the name of the player-owned structure.
* *solar_system_id* - gives the solar system where the structure resides.

The use for this endpoint is not obvious until one needs to calculate which orders will match in a given region.  As described above, the buy orders which match a given sell order are determined by the location of the sell order, and the range and location of each buy order.  Therefore, the location of player-owned structures must be known in order to determine whether buy orders submitted at those structures can potentially match.  At time of writing, the structure location endpoint is the only third party API which provides access to the location of public player-owned structures.  However, as we discussed in [Order Book Data Endpoints](#order-book-data-endpoints), the order book for a region may also display buy orders from non-public player-owned structures.  The structure location endpoint can not be used to determine the location of these structures unless the \(authenticated\) caller is authorized to view this data \(for example, the caller is a member of the corporation which owns the player-owned structure\).  Fortunately, there is at least one third party data source that attempts to document the location of non-public structures.  We show an example of using the structure location endpoint, as well as other third party data sources, when we construct an order matching algorithm in [Example 3](#example-3---trading-rules-build-an-order-matching-algorithm) below.  

### Discovering Trade Data

As noted above, CCP currently does not provide an API endpoint for retrieving individual trades.  This lack of data is limiting in some cases, but fortunately a portion of trades can be inferred by observing changes in order book data.  This approach is effective for trades that do not completely consume a standing limit order.  However, limit orders which are removed from the order book can not be distinguished from cancelled orders.  Thus, the best we can do is rely on heuristics to attempt to estimate trades we can't otherwise infer.  Because CCP publishes daily trade volume, we do have some measure of how close our heuristics match reality.  We'll derive a simple trade estimation heuristic in [Example 4](#example-4---unpublished-data-build-a-trade-heuristic) below.

## Tools used in this Book

This section provides an introduction to the tools we use to develop strategies in the remainder of the book.  As you may have surmised, access to historic and live market data is critically important for analysis, back test, live testing and execution of trading strategies.  Many third party sites provide this data in various formats.  At Orbital Enterprises, we've created our own market data collection tools which we describe below.  Our tools, as well as most modern tools \(including the EVE Swagger Interface\), use web interfaces annotated with [Swagger](http://swagger.io/).  We therefore provide a brief introduction to Swagger along with a few tips for working with Swagger-annotated endpoints.  Finally, we briefly introduce [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) which has quickly become the de facto data science tool in python.  Most of the examples we provide in the book are shared as Jupyter notebooks on our [GitHub site](https://github.com/OrbitalEnterprises/eve-market-strategies).

[^2]: Moreover, it is not uncommon for buy orders to be placed from non-public player-owned structures.  This is mostly a nuisance for processing market data.
[^3]: Some financial markets have "dark pools" which are off exchange markets, usually reserved for specific types of transactions.  Dark pools do not always guarantee anonymity.
[^4]: Arbitrage and market-making strategies are well suited to automated trading (i.e. "botting").  However, this is explicitly forbidden by the EULA.
[^5]: CCP has an interesting view on the legality of these efforts.  The End User License Agreement (EULA) explicitly forbids cache scraping.  However, CCP has consistently said that they enforce the EULA at their discretion and, practically speaking, they have tolerated scraping market data for many years.  More recently, CCP has said many of their new third party APIs are intended to eliminate the need for cache scraping.  The new market data APIs are a direct result of such efforts.
[^6]: The size of the window for this average, and whether the average is over all regions is not documented anywhere.
