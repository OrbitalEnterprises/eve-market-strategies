# Preface

EVE Online is unique among online games in that the in-game market has significant importance to players, regardless of the game play style they choose to pursue. Whether in high, low or null security, many \(probably all\) players rely on EVE’s markets to buy and equip ships, sell acquired or produced goods, buy supplies needed for various endeavors, and otherwise fill gaps in the set of things needed to pursue various play styles.

As the market has long been an important feature of EVE, some players have similarly focused on developing tools and strategies to support the use of markets. In the early days, these tools were intended to supplement standard play styles, for example making it easier to track market participation \(e.g. positions, open orders\) as part of a larger strategy \(e.g. mining, production, conquest\). However, as the game has grown, so has the sophistication of the markets, and in modern EVE “playing the markets” is a valid play style pursued by many players.  Third party tool developers have adopted to these changes as well, with many new tools written explicitly to support profiting from the market.  CCP, for their part, has responded by providing more real-time data \(e.g. five minute market snapshots\), and more visibility into alternative markets \(e.g. citadel markets\). The combination of new tools and rich data has made it possible to implement many “real life” trading strategies that were previously difficult to execute[^1].

This book attempts to be a systematic discussion of data driven analysis and trading strategies in EVE's markets.  The strategies we derive here rely on public data provided by CCP.  Not all of this data is market data and, in fact, more complicated strategies often rely on non-market data. Regardless, all of this data is publicly available: the strategies we describe here don’t rely on non-public or otherwise proprietary data.  We derive concepts and strategies using publicly available tools, and we share our techniques through a number of examples \(including source code\).  While the example code we present here is suitable for illustrative purposes, serious market players will likely want to write custom, optimized code for certain strategies \(as the author does\).

## Summary of Chapters

The remainder of the book is organized as follows:

* [Chapter 1 - Preliminaries](01-preliminaries.md)
  This chapters describes key features of the EVE markets and introduces tools and data sources used to describe trading strategies.  This chapter concludes with several examples introducing the tools.
* [Chapter 2 - Arbitrage](02-arbitrage.md)
  This chapter describes arbitrage trading which is the process of discovering undervalued market items which can be purchased and turned into profit very quickly.
* [Chapter 3 - Market Making](03-market-making.md)
  This chapter describes market making strategies, better known as station trading, which profits from market participants willing to "cross the spread" instead of waiting for better prices through limit orders.

## Change Log

* 2017-02-12: Beyond the initial three chapters, we have three additional chapters planned:
  * "Simulating Trading Strategies" - eventually this will describe a simple back test simulator we're developing.
  * "Risk" - this chapter will give a more careful treatment to risk around trading \(and EVE in general\).
  * "Trend Trading" - this chapter will discuss trend-based trading strategies.

[^1]: I'm not claiming CCP intended to enable specific trading strategies, only that the data available now makes this possible.
