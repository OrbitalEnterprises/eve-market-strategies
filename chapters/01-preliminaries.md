# Preliminaries

This chapter explains the mechanics of EVE markets and introduces the various sources of market data we use to develop trading strategies.  We also introduce the tools we'll use in the rest of the book to develop our strategies.  We end the chapter with several examples illustrating these tools.

## Market Structure

EVE markets are governed by a set of rules which define how orders are placed, how they are matched, and what charges are imposed on the participants in a trade.  Market structure in EVE is somewhat unique, but if comparisons to actual financial markets must be made, then EVE markets are most similar to a commodities spot market.  Commodities markets trade physical assets \(or rather, the right of ownership of assets\), much the same as trading occurs in EVE markets.  A "spot market" is a market in which assets are exchanged at current prices, as opposed to prices guaranteed by a contract \(e.g. futures markets\).

Many good descriptions of EVE markets are already available on the web.  We recommend reading EVE University's [Trading Introduction](http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Trading) for a thorough overview of the interface, important skills and basic mechanics.  Rather than recount that description here, we instead provide a more academic treatment of some key aspects of EVE markets below.

### Order Mechanics

There are two order types in EVE markets:

* A *market order* is an instruction to buy or sell an asset at the current best available price.
* A *limit order* is an instruction to buy or sell an asset at a fixed price, which may be different than the current best available price.

Although this terminology is standard in financial literature, the EVE UI does not use these terms in order placement screens.  Generally speaking, if you are placing an order using the "advanced" UI screen \(with a duration other than "immediate"\), then you are placing a limit order.  Otherwise, you are placing a market order.  This is true even if your limit order is matched immediately, and has important consequences in terms of trading cost \(see below\).

Orders are handled "First In, First Out" \(FIFO\), meaning the sequence of order arrival determines priority for matching with other orders.  When a sell order is placed, the items being sold are placed in escrow at the seller's location.  If a sell order is filled, then the sold items are moved to the buyer's hangar at the seller's location.  In other words, all transactions occur at the seller's location.  This has at least two important consequences for trading strategies:

1. If the buyer is not in the same station as the seller, then the buyer may need to transport purchased goods elsewhere; and,
2. If the seller is in a player-owned structure which is not accessible to the buyer \(e.g. access controls are changed after the sale\), then the buyer's assets may become stranded.

Market participation from player-owned structures is a relatively recent feature \(at time of writing\).  However, the number of such participants is growing, making it important to consider access risk when buying goods from sellers in these structures.[^2]

### Price Formation

Trade prices in EVE markets are determined by order matching rules.  Unlike other financial markets, there is no facility for price negotiation or auction, although some of these features exist in secondary markets \(e.g. the contract system\).  Sell orders in EVE have a location, price, quantity and minimum volume.  Buy orders have a location, price, quantity, minimum volume and range.  A pair of orders match when:

1. The location of the sell order is within range of the location specified in the buy order.
2. The sell order represents the first, lowest priced sell order within range of the buy order.
3. The buy order represents the first, highest priced buy order within range of the sell order.
4. A price exists which meets the pricing constraints \(see below\).

The price at which the transaction occurs must satisfy the following constraints:

1. A sell limit order must match at or above the posted price on the order.
2. A buy limit order must match at or below the posted price on the order.
3. A buy or sell market order must match at the posted price on the order.
4. If the sell order has precedence \(arrived at the market first\), then the transaction price is the maximum price which satisfies the above constraints.
5. If the buy order has precedence, then the transaction price is the minimum price which satisfies the above constraints.

The effect of precedence rules means that some care must be taken when pricing orders.  For example, suppose a sell limit order is placed for 100 ISK.  Suppose further that this order is currently the best available sale price \(i.e. the first, lowest price available in the current location\).  If a buy limit order is then placed for 101 ISK, then this order will match immediately at a price of 101 ISK \(*not* 100 ISK\) because the sell order has precedence.  A similar behavior occurs when buy limit orders have precedence.

### Transaction Costs

EVE markets impose two fees on orders:

* *Broker Fees* are charged at order placement time for all limit orders \(even orders which match immediately\).  The owner of the order is charged this fee.
* *Sales Tax* is charged each time a sell order is matched and is paid by the seller.

Broker fees are charged as a percentage of the total order value, with the charge normally between 2.5% and 5% \(adjusted by standing and the Broker Relations skill\).  Sales tax is charged as a percentage of the matched order volume multiplied by the match price, with the charge normally between 1% and 2% \(adjusted by the Accounting Skill\).  Sales tax in player-owned structures is determined by the owner and may be lower than the normal range.

There are two important consequences of this fee structure:

1. Market buy orders incur no fees.  Thus, it can sometimes be advantageous to simply wait for a good price instead of placing a limit buy order \(which will incur a broker fee\); and,
2. The fees determine the minimum return required for a profitable strategy.  For example, a typical market making strategy which uses limit orders on both the buy and sell side will need to return at least 6% to be profitable \(5% paid on both sides for limit orders, plus 1% sales tax on transactions\).

Training Broker Relations and Accounting skills is usually mandatory for serious EVE market players as these skills at max training reduce fees by a significant amount.

### Information Disclosure

The primary live source of information for EVE markets is the game client UI which shows a live view of the current order book for each asset, as well as historical pricing information.  CCP provides third party developer APIs which expose similar information \(see below\), but the game client is always the most up to date view of the markets.  Several important metrics are visible from the game client including the volume \(total assets traded\) to date, and the current spread \(difference between best buy price and best sell price\) between buyers and sellers.  The order book for a given asset displays price, volume and location for each order, but does *not* display the names of market participants.  However, the names of market participants *are* recorded and visible to each counterparty when a transaction is completed.  This is a unique feature of EVE markets which is quite different from other financial markets where anonymity is preserved between counterparties.[^3]  This feature also provides an opportunity for traders to gather more information about other market participants, for example by buying or selling in small quantities to competing bids in order to discover the names of competitors.

Recent EVE expansions have added the ability to create market hubs in player-owned structures.  These hubs are added to the market for the region they are located in, allowing orders to be placed from player-owned locations.  Although market hubs are now included in regional markets, the player-owned structure itself may not be publicly accessible, or accessibility may change during the course of a day's market events.  As a result:

* Sell orders may appear from player-owned structures, but sold items may be inaccessible if a structure changes access after the transaction completes; and,
* Buy orders may appear from non-public player-owned structures.  The location of these structures is visible in game, but is currently *not* visible in data out of game \(e.g. third party APIs\).

It is generally safe to sell to orders placed from player-owned structures.  However, great care should be taken when buying from orders placed from player-owned structures.  Missing location information in out of game data sources is mostly an annoyance right now as workarounds exist to obtain the needed information.

### Contract System

EVE has a large secondary market called the "contract system" which allows for direct player to player exchange of numerous assets, including assets which are not tradable on EVE markets \(e.g. fitted ships\).  We don't cover the contract system is this book, mainly because there is currently no reliable third party API to gather information about available contracts.

## Market Data

As noted above, market data is visible in the game client in two separate views:

1. A view of the current order book for an asset in a region; and
2. A view of the daily high, low, and average trade prices \(and related metrics\), and total volume for an asset as far back as one year.

The game client always shows the most recent view of market data.  All other data sources \(e.g. third party developer sources\) lag the game client.  It's also worth noting that the game client is the only EULA-approved way to participate in the market by buying or selling assets.[^4]

Data driven development of trading strategies is usually conducted offline, preferably using several years of market data.  CCP has only recently invested effort in making market data easily accessible to third party developers.  Historically, market data was gathered through crowd sourcing efforts by scraping cached data stored in the game client.[^5]  Scraped data was then aggregated and made available by third party sites like [EVE Central](https://eve-central.com/).  Asset coverage relied on having enough players interested in regularly viewing certain assets \(so that the client cache would be refreshed regularly\).  The fact that players themselves were providing data also raised concerns about purposely modifying data to affect game play.  Despite these limitations and risks, crowd sourced data was the primary source of market data for many years.  

In 2015, CCP started providing market history, order book, and market pricing data through their ["CREST" API](https://eveonline-third-party-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/crest/index.html).  CREST is a REST-based web API which supports both public and authorized data endpoints.  Authorized endpoints use the [EVE Single Sign-On](https://eveonline-third-party-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sso/index.html) service based on OAuth access control.  CREST authorization is only used for certain player or corporation related endpoints.  Market data can be accessed on CREST without authentication.  When market modules were released for player-owned structures \(e.g. Citadels\), public buy orders placed in these modules were eventually made visible in CREST market data.  However, CREST provided no mechanism for resolving the location where these player-owned structures resided, making it difficult to implement the same order matching rules as provided in the game client.

While CREST was an important upgrade for third party developers \(as compared to the [XML API](https://eveonline-third-party-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/xmlapi/index.html)\), CCP significantly modernized third party APIs by releasing the [EVE Swagger Interface \(ESI\)](https://esi.tech.ccp.is/latest/) which exposed a new REST-based web API documented with [Swagger](http://swagger.io/).  Swagger documentation allows the use of many convenient tools for third party developers, such as API browsers and client generators in a variety of languages.  Swagger also provides clean support for versioning and authorization, making it much easier for CCP to evolve the API over time.  The ESI provides the same market data as in CREST with two important upgrades:

1. A facility for resolving the location of certain player-owned structures; and,
2. Access to order book data local to player-owned structures.

The ESI uses the same OAuth based authorization scheme as CREST.  At time of writing, CCP has declared ESI as the API of the future and has deprecate both CREST and the XML API.  However, CCP has stated they will keep the XML API and CREST active at least until ESI reaches feature parity.  Unless otherwise indicated, examples in this book which require direct access to live market data will use the ESI endpoints.

The remainder of this section describes the main market data ESI endpoints in more detail.  

### Market History Endpoints

The market history endpoint returns a daily price summary for a given asset type in a given region.  In financial modeling terms, this data is similar to daily stock market data.  The market history endpoint returns all data from the start of the previous calendar year.

We'll use market history to demonstrate the use of the ESI.  ESI endpoints follow REST conventions and can always be accessed using the HTTP protocol.  For example, the following URL will return market history for Tritanium \(type 34\) in Forge \(region 10000002\):

```
https://esi.tech.ccp.is/latest/markets/10000002/history/?datasource=tranquility&type_id=34
```

The result of this request will be a JSON formatted array of values of the form:

```json
{
  "date": "2015-05-01",
  "average": 5.25,
  "highest": 5.27,
  "lowest": 5.11,
  "order_count": 2267,
  "volume": 16276782035
}
```

where:

* *date* - gives the date for which the values are reported.
* *average* - gives the average trade price of the asset for the day.
* *highest* - gives the highest trade price of the asset for the day.
* *lowest* - gives the lowest trade price of the asset for the day.
* *order_count* - gives the number of trades for the day.
* *volume* - gives the number of units traded for the day.

What makes the ESI special is the Swagger definition which can be retrieved at:

```
https://esi.tech.ccp.is/latest/swagger.json?datasource=tranquility
```

The Swagger definition is a structured description of the endpoints of ESI, including the name and type of the arguments required, the format of the result, and any authorization that may be required.  Tools make use of this definition to automatically generate documentation and API clients.  For example, the documentation of the above endpoint can be found [here](https://esi.tech.ccp.is/latest/#!/Market/get_markets_region_id_history).

In addition to the response body, the ESI also returns several important HTTP response headers.  There are three headers you should observe:

* *date* - this is the date at the server when the result was generated.  All dates are normally UTC \(i.e. "EVE" time\).
* *last-modified* - this is the date the response body was last changed.  The difference between *date* and *last-modified* gives the age of the data.
* *expires* - this is the date when the current response body should be refreshed.  It will be unproductive to request the data again before this time.

The *expires* field is important for automated collection of data, and for competitive analysis.  The tools we describe later in this chapter use *expires* to drive regular downloads of the data for historical analysis.  The *expires* field also tells you how frequently other market participants can see fresh data \(unless they are using the game client\).

### Order Book Data Endpoints

The market order book endpoints return a view of the current orders for a given region, optionally restricted to a given type.  The ESI endpoint to retrieve this data is ["get market region orders"](https://esi.tech.ccp.is/latest/#!/Market/get_markets_region_id_orders).  The following URL will retrieve the first page of orders for Tritanium \(type 34\) in Forge \(region 10000002\):

```
https://esi.tech.ccp.is/latest/markets/10000002/orders/?datasource=tranquility&order_type=all&page=1&type_id=34
```

Leaving off `type_id=34` will return all orders for all types in the given region.  The result of this request will be a JSON formatted array of values of the form:

```json
{
  "order_id": 4740968511,
  "type_id": 34,
  "location_id": 60005599,
  "volume_total": 1296000,
  "volume_remain": 952089,
  "min_volume": 1,
  "price": 10,
  "is_buy_order": false,
  "duration": 90,
  "issued": "2017-01-06T22:29:36Z",
  "range": "region"
}
```

where:

* *order_id* - gives the unique order id for this order.
* *type_id* - gives the type of asset transacted by this order.
* *location_id* - gives the location where this order was placed.  The location is important for computing possible order matches and is discussed in more detail below.
* *volume_total* - gives the total number of assets to be transacted when the order was placed.
* *volume_remain* - gives the number of assets still left to be transacted for this order.
* *min_volume* - gives the minimum number of assets which must be exchanged each time this order is matched.  Note that "volume\_remain" can be less than "min\_volume", in which case fewer assets may transact on the last match for the order.
* *price* - is the posted priced for the order.
* *is_buy_order* - is true if the order is a "bid" \(buy\), otherwise the order is an "ask" \(sell\).
* *duration* - is the length of time in days that the order will remain in the book until it is matched.
* *issued* - is the issue date of the order.
* *range* - only applies to bids and is the maximum distance from the origin station that an ask will be allowed to match.

Order book data is the most current out of game view of the markets and is therefore very important data for many traders.  Some important properties about order book data:

* At time of writing, order book data is refreshed every five minutes.  That is, your view of market data may be up to five minutes old.  You can refer to the *expires* response header to determine when the order book will be refreshed.
* Order book data for most active regions can not be returned in a single API call \(unless filtering for a single type\).  Instead, book data is "paged" across multiple calls.  The requested page is controlled by the "page" argument as shown in the URL above.  The ESI does not report how many total pages are available.  The normal solution is to continue to retrieve pages until a page is returned containing less than 10000 orders.  This indicates the last page available for the query.  The "page" argument is ignored for requests filtered by type.
* Order book data may include orders from player-owned structures, some of which may be non-public.  Orders from non-public structures cause problems for out of game analysis because the ESI currently provides no way to discover the location of these structures.  Crowd sourced data can be used in these cases \(see [Example 3 - Trading Rules: Build an Order Matching Algorithm](#example-3---trading-rules-build-an-order-matching-algorithm) below\).

Order book data can also be requested directly from player-owned structures.  This is done using the ["get markets structures"](https://esi.tech.ccp.is/latest/#!/Market/get_markets_structures_structure_id) endpoint.  Some player-owned markets are not public, despite their buy orders appearing the regional market, but for those that allow access, the format of the results is identical to the format returned by the ["get market region orders"](https://esi.tech.ccp.is/latest/#!/Market/get_markets_region_id_orders) endpoint.

### Pricing Data Endpoints

Certain industrial calculations, such as reprocessing tax, require reference price data computed by CCP on a daily basis.  This data is available to third party developers using the ["get market prices"](https://esi.tech.ccp.is/latest/#!/Market/get_markets_prices) endpoint.  A request to this endpoint will return an array of price data in this format:

```json
{
  "type_id": 32772,
  "average_price": 501374.49,
  "adjusted_price": 502330.89
}
```

where:

* *type_id* - gives the asset type.
* *average_price* - gives a rolling average price[^6].
* *adjusted_price* - gives a formulaic price which is used as a reference price in several calculations.  The formula by which this price is computed is not publicly documented.

We document this endpoint because some strategies discussed in later chapters need to compute certain industrial formulas.

### Structure Location Endpoints

The last market data endpoint we document is the ["get universe structure id"](https://esi.tech.ccp.is/latest/#!/Universe/get_universe_structures_structure_id) endpoint.  This is an authenticated endpoint which provides player-owned structure information in the format:

```json
{
  "name": "V-3YG7 VI - The Capital",
  "solar_system_id": 30000142
}
```

where:

* *name* - gives the name of the player-owned structure.
* *solar_system_id* - gives the solar system where the structure resides.

The use for this endpoint is not obvious until one needs to calculate which orders will match in a given region.  As described above, the buy orders which match a given sell order are determined by the location of the sell order, and the range and location of each buy order.  Therefore, the location of player-owned structures must be known in order to determine whether buy orders submitted at those structures can potentially match.  At time of writing, the structure location endpoint is the only third party API which provides access to the location of public player-owned structures.  However, as we discussed in [Order Book Data Endpoints](#order-book-data-endpoints), the order book for a region may also display buy orders from non-public player-owned structures.  The structure location endpoint can not be used to determine the location of these structures unless the \(authenticated\) caller is authorized to view this data \(for example, the caller is a member of the corporation which owns the player-owned structure\).  Fortunately, there is at least one third party data source that attempts to document the location of non-public structures.  We show an example of using the structure location endpoint, as well as other third party data sources, when we construct an order matching algorithm in [Example 3](#example-3---trading-rules-build-an-order-matching-algorithm) below.  

### Discovering Trade Data

As noted above, CCP currently does not provide an API endpoint for retrieving individual trades.  This lack of data is limiting in some cases, but fortunately a portion of trades can be inferred by observing changes in order book data.  This approach is effective for trades that do not completely consume a standing limit order.  However, limit orders which are removed from the order book can not be distinguished from cancelled orders.  Thus, the best we can do is rely on heuristics to attempt to estimate trades we can't otherwise infer.  Because CCP publishes daily trade volume, we do have some measure of how close our heuristics match reality.  We'll derive a simple trade estimation heuristic in [Example 4](#example-4---unpublished-data-build-a-trade-heuristic) below.

## Tools used in this Book

This section provides an introduction to the tools we use to develop strategies in the remainder of the book.  As you may have surmised, access to historic and live market data is critically important for analysis, back test, live testing and execution of trading strategies.  Many third party sites provide this data in various formats.  At Orbital Enterprises, we've created our own market data collection tools which we describe below.  Our tools, as well as most modern tools \(including the EVE Swagger Interface\), use web interfaces annotated with [Swagger](http://swagger.io/).  We therefore provide a brief introduction to Swagger along with a few tips for working with Swagger-annotated endpoints.  The [EVE Static Data Export (SDE)](https://developers.eveonline.com/resource/resources) is another critical resource for third party developers and is needed for some of the strategies we described in this book.  The SDE is provided as a raw data export which most players acquire themselves.  At Orbital Enterprises, we've created an online tool for accessing the SDE which we use in our examples.  We describe this tool below.  Finally, we briefly introduce [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) which has quickly become the de facto data science tool in python.  Most of the examples we provide in the book are shared as Jupyter notebooks on our [GitHub site](https://github.com/OrbitalEnterprises/eve-market-strategies).

### Market Data Tools

Orbital Enterprises hosts a [market collection service](https://evekit.orbital.enterprises//#/md/main) which provides historic and live access to book data and daily market snapshots \(the "Order Book Data" and "Market History" endpoints described above, respectively\).  The service exposes a Swagger annotated API which can be accessed [interactively](https://evekit.orbital.enterprises//#/md/ui).  Historic data is uploaded nightly to [Google Storage](https://storage.googleapis.com/evekit_md) organized by date.  Although the entire history maintained by the site is accessible through the service API, for research and back testing purposes it is usually more convenient to download the data in bulk from the Google Storage site.

> About Swagger
>
> [Swagger](http://swagger.io/) is a configuration language for describing REST-based web services.  A Swagger-annotated web site will normally provide a `swagger.json` file which defines the services provided by the site.  For example, CCP's EVE Swagger Interface provides [this `swagger.json` file](https://esi.tech.ccp.is/latest/swagger.json?datasource=tranquility).
>
> The power of Swagger is that the `swagger.json` file can be provided as input to tools which automate the generation of documentation and client code.  For example, the [Swagger UI](http://petstore.swagger.io/) will generate an interactive UI for any valid Swagger specification.  The [Swagger Editor](http://editor.swagger.io/#/) has similar capabilities but will also generate clients \(and servers\) in a variety of programming languages.  In most cases, you won't ever need to manually inspect a Swagger configuration file \(much less learn the configuration language\) as the tooling does all the hard work for you.
>
> In this book, we introduce many APIs using the Swagger UI.  You can follow along by browsing to the generic [Swagger UI](http://petstore.swagger.io/) and inserting the URL for the appropriate `swagger.json` configuration file.  Most of our code samples are in Python for which we use the [Bravado](https://github.com/Yelp/bravado) Swagger client generator.  We'll describe Bravado in more detail below.
>
> **NOTE:** the generic Swagger UI will *not* work with authorized endpoints of the ESI.  This is because of the way single sign-on is implemented with the ESI servers.  Using authorized endpoints from batch \(i.e. non-interactive\) code is likewise challenging.  One work around is to use a proxy like the [ESI Proxy](https://github.com/OrbitalEnterprises/orbital-esi-proxy) which we use at Orbital Enterprises.  This proxy handles OAuth authorization flows automatically, exposing a much simpler interface to our market strategy code.

Let's use the Swagger UI to introduce the Orbital Enterprises market collection service.  You can follow along by browsing to the [interactive UI](https://evekit.orbital.enterprises//#/md/ui).  The UI lists three endpoints:

![EveKit MarketData Server](img/mcs_view_1.PNG)

These endpoints provide the following functons:

* *history* - retrieves market history by type, region and date.
* *book* - retrieves the order book snapshot by type and region closest to a specified time stamp.
* *livebook* - a specialized version of the *book* endpoint which always retrieves the latest order book snapshot for a region and list of type IDs.

Each endpoint can be expanded to view documentation and call the service.  For example, expanding the *history* endpoint reveals:

![Expanded History Endpoint](img/mcs_view_2.PNG)

Filling in the *typeID*, *regionID* and *date* fields with "34", "10000002" and "2017-01-15" returns the following result \(Click "Try it out!"\):

![Market history for Tritanium (type 34) in The Forge (region 10000002) on 2017-01-15](img/mcs_view_3.PNG)

The fields in the result match the "Market History" ESI endpoint with following additions:

* *typeID* - the type ID of the result.
* *regionID* - the region ID of the result.
* *date* - the retrieval date timestamp in milliseconds UTC since the epoch \(1970-01-01 00:00:00\).

The *book* endpoint has a similar interface but since order book snapshots have five minute resolution \(based on the cache timer for the endpoint\), you can provide a full timestamp.  The endpoint will return the latest book snapshot before the specified date/time.  Here is the result of the same query above at 10:00 \(UTC\):

![Book snapshot for Tritanium (type 34) in the Forge (region 10000002) at 2017-01-15T10:00:00](img/mcs_view_4.PNG)

The result is a JSON object where the *bookTime* field records the snapshot time in milliseconds UTC since the epoch.  The *orders* field list the buy and sell orders in the order book snapshot.  The fields in the order results match the "Order Book Data" ESI endpoint with some slight modifications \(e.g. timestamps are converted to milliseconds UTC since the epoch\) and the addition of *typeID* and *regionID* fields.

The *livebook* endpoint is identical to the *book* endpoint with two main differences:

1. You may specify multiple type IDs \(up to 100 at time of writing\).  The result will contain order books for all the requested types.
2. The result always represents the latest live data.  That is, there is no *date* argument to this endpoint.

The *livebook* endpoint is most useful for live testing or live execution of trading strategies.  We use this endpoint in the later chapters for specific strategies.

As we noted above, the endpoints of the market collection service are most useful for casual testing or for retrieving live data for running strategies.  For back testing, it is usually more convenient to download historic data in bulk to local storage.  The format of historic data is described on the [market collection service site](https://evekit.orbital.enterprises//#/md/main).  We introduce python code to read historic data below, either directly from Google Storage, or from local storage.

### Static Data Export \(SDE\)

The EVE Static Data Export is a regularly released static dump of in-game reference material.  We've already seen data provided by the SDE in the last section - the numeric values for Tritanium (type ID 34) and The Forge (region ID 10000002) were provided by the SDE.  The SDE is released by CCP at the [Developer Resources Site](https://developers.eveonline.com/resource/resources).  The modern version of the SDE consists of [YAML](http://www.yaml.org/) formatted files.  However, most players find it more convenient to access the SDE from a relational database.  Steve Ronuken provides conversions of the raw SDE export to various database formats at his [Fuzzworks site](https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/dump/).

At Orbital Enterprises, we expose the latest two releases of the SDE as an [online service](https://evekit.orbital.enterprises//#/sde/main).  The underlying data is just Steve Ronuken's MySQL conversion accessed through a Swagger-annotated web service we provide.  If you don't want to download the SDE yourself, you may want to use our online service instead.  Most of the examples we present in this book use the Orbital Enterprises service.

Because our service is Swagger-annotated, there is a ready made [interactive service](https://evekit.orbital.enterprises//#/sde/ui) you can use to access the SDE:

![Orbital Enterprises Online SDE UI](img/sde_view_1.PNG)

The "Release" drop down at the top can be used to select which SDE release to query against \(the default is the latest release\).  At time of writing, we always maintain the two latest releases.  We may consider maintaining more releases in the future.  Queries against the online service use JSON expressions which are explained on the [main site](https://evekit.orbital.enterprises//#/sde/main).  As an example, let's look at a query to determine the type ID for Tritanium.  First expand the "Inventory" section, then select "/inv/type":

![Partial view of the Inventory - Type endpoint](img/sde_view_2.PNG)

We'll search by partial name.  Scroll down until the "typeName" field is visible and replace the default query value with `{ like: '%trit%' }`.  Then click "Try it out!" \(or just hit enter\).  You'll see a result similar to the following:

![SDE query result](img/sde_view_3.PNG)

The result includes all types with names that contain the string "trit" \(case insensitive\).  There are many such types, but the first result in this example happens to be the type we were searching for.  Most of the market strategies we describe in this book rely on data in the "Inventory" and "Map" sections of the SDE.  You can find reasonably recent documentation on the data stored in the SDE at the crowd sources [Third Party Developer](http://eveonline-third-party-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) documentation site.  We provide more explicit documentation in the sections below where we use the SDE.

### Jupyter Notebook

Our method for developing trading strategies could loosely be called "data science", meaning we use scientific methods and tools for extracting knowledge or insight from raw data.  Our main tool is the Python programming language around which a rich set of libraries and methodologies have been developed to support data science.  Strategy development is an iterative process, and during the early stages of development it is useful to have tools which are interactive in nature.  The [Jupyter Project](http://jupyter.org/) and its predecessor [iPython](https://ipython.org/) are arguably the most popular interactive tools for data science with Python[^7].  When combined with [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) and [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/), the Jupyter platform provides a very capable interactive data science environment.  We use this environment almost exclusively in the examples we describe in this book.  It is not mandatory, but you'll get much more out of this book if you install Jupyter yourself and try out some of our examples.

The easiest way to get started with Jupyter is to install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) which is available for Windows, Mac and Linux.  Anaconda is a convenient packaging of several open source data science tools for Python (also R and Scala), and also includes Jupyter.  Once you've installed Anaconda, you can get started with Jupyter by following the [quickstart](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running.html) instructions \(essentially just `jupyter notebook` in a shell and you're ready\).  If you're reasonably familiar with Python you can crash ahead and click "New -> Python 3" from your local Jupyter instance to create your first notebook.  If you'd like a more comprehensive introduction, we like [this tutorial](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tutorial-jupyter-notebook).

> Python 2 or Python 3?
>
> If you're familiar with Python, you'll know that Python 3 is the recommended environment for new code but, unfortunately, Python 3 broke compatibility with Python 2 in many areas.  Moreover, the large quantity of code still written in Python 2 \(at time of writing\) often leaves developers with a difficult decision as to which environment to use.  Fortunately, all of the data science libraries we need for this book have been ported to Python 3.  So we've made the decision to use Python 3 exclusively in this book.  If you *must* use Python 2, you'll find that most of our examples can be back-ported without difficulty.  However, if you don't have a strong reason to use Python 2, we recommend you stick with Python 3.

The main interface to Jupyter is the notebook, which is a language *kernel* combined with code, text, graphs, etc.  A language kernel is a backend capable of executing code in a given language.  All of the examples we present in this section use the Python 3 language kernel, but Jupyter allows you to install other kernels as well \(e.g. Python 2, R, Scala, Java, etc.\).  The code within a notebook is executed by the kernel with output displayed in the notebook.  Text, graphic and other non-code artifacts are handled by the Jupyter environment itself and provide a way to document your work, or develop instructional material \(as we're doing in this book\).  Notebooks naturally keep a history of your actions \(numbered code or text sections\) and allow you to edit and re-run previous bits of code.  That is, to iterate on your experiments.  Finally, notebooks automatically checkpoint \(i.e. regularly save your progress\) and can be saved and restored at a later time.  Make sure you run your notebook on a reasonably powerful machine, however, as deeper data analysis will use up significant memory.

The environment installed from Anaconda has most of the code we'll need, but from time to time you may need to install other code.  In this book, we do this in two cases:

1. We'll install a few libraries that typically aren't included in Anaconda.  In fact, we'll do this almost immediately in the first example below so that we can use the [Bravado](https://github.com/Yelp/bravado) library for interacting with Swagger-annotated web services.

2. As we work through the examples, we'll begin to develop a set of useful libraries we'll want to use in later examples.  We *could* copy this code to each of our notebooks but that would start to clutter our examples.  Instead, we'll show you how to install these libraries in the default path used by the Jupyter kernel.

We'll provide instructions for installing missing libraries in the examples where they are needed.  Including your own code into Jupyter is a matter of ensuring the path to your packages is included in the "python path" used by Jupyter.  If you're already familiar with Python, you're free to choose your favorite way of adding your local path.  If you're less familiar with Python, we suggest adding your packages to your local `.ipython` folder which is created the first time you start a Python kernel in Jupyter.  This directory will be created in the home directory of the user which started the kernel.

> Python Virtual Environments
>
> Notebooks provide a basic level of code isolation, but all notebooks share the set of packages installed in the Python kernel \(as well as any default modifications made to the Python path\).  This means that any new packages you install \(such as those we provide instructions for in some of the examples\) will affect all notebooks.  This can cause version problems when two different notebooks rely on two different versions of the same package.  For this reason, Python professionals try to avoid installing project specific packages in the "global" Python kernel.  Instead, the pros create one or more "virtual environments" which isolate the customizations needed for specific work.  This lets you divide your experiments so that work in one experiment doesn't accidentally break the work you've already done in another experiment.
>
> Virtual environments are an advanced topic which we won't try to cover here.  Interested parties should check out the [virtualenv](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv) package or read up on using [Conda](https://conda.io/docs/) to set up isolated development environments.  In our experience, it is easier to use `conda` to create separate Jupyter environments, but instructions exist for using `virtualenv` to do this as well.  We document our Conda setup at the end of this chapter for the curious.

## Simple Strategies and Calculations

We finish this chapter with code examples illustrating basic techniques we use in the remainder of the book.  If you'd like to follow along, you'll need to install Jupyter as described in the previous section.  As always, you can find our code as well as Jupyter notebooks in the `code` directory in our [GitHub project](https://github.com/OrbitalEnterprises/eve-market-strategies).

### Example 1 - Data Extraction: Make a Graph of Market History

In this example, we're going to create a simple graph of market history \(i.e. daily price snapshots\) for a year of data.  We'll arbitrarily choose to graph Tritanium in Forge.  When we're done, we'll have a graph like the following:

![Tritanium price over a year in The Forge](img/ex1_graph.PNG)

We'll use this simple example to introduce basic operations we'll use throughout this book.  If you want to follow along, you can download the [Jupyter notebook](code/book/ex1.ipynb) for this example.

We'll create our graph as follows:

1. We'll use the Static Data Export \(SDE\) to look up the type and region ID, respectively, for "Tritanium" and "The Forge".
2. Next, we'll construct a date range for a year of data from the current date.
3. Then, we'll use the market data service to download daily market snapshots for our date range, and store the data in a Pandas dataframe.
4. Finally, we'll graph average price from the data frame.

We'll expand on a few variants of these steps at the end of the example to set up for later examples.  But before we can do any of this, we need to install [Bravado](https://github.com/Yelp/bravado) in order to access Swagger-annotated web services.  You can install bravado as follows \(do this before you start Jupyter\):

```bash
$ pip install bravado
```

> Installing Bravado on Windows
>
> On Windows, you may see an error message about missing C++ tools when building the "twisted" library.  You can get these tools for free from Microsoft at [this link](http://landinghub.visualstudio.com/visual-cpp-build-tools).  Once these tools are installed, you should be able to complete the install of bravado.

### Setting up Isolated Environments with Conda

If you installed Jupyter using [Anaconda]() then you already have `conda` which can be used to create isolated environments for experiments.  We use `conda` to first create a minimal base environment with Jupyter and related libraries.  We then clone this environment as need for our experiments.  Our base environment is created as follows \(this is Windows syntax, adjust as appropriate for your environment\):

```bash
$ conda create -n book_base
$ activate book_base
(book_base) $ conda install jupyter
(book_base) $ conda install pandas
(book_base) $ conda install matplotlib
```

You can then deactivate this environment and clone it later for each isolated environment you'd like to create.  We create our isolated environments as follows:

```bash
$ mkdir exp_1
$ cd exp_1
$ mkdir .ipython
$ mkdir .jupyter
$ cat > setup.bat
@REM execute this before you start jupyter in this environment
@SET JUPYTER_CONFIG_DIR=your_path/exp_1/.jupyter
@SET IPYTHONDIR=your_path/exp_1/.ipython
$ conda create -n book_exp_1 --clone book_base
```

You can then activate your new environment and start jupyter as follows:

```bash
$ activate book_exp_1
(book_exp_1) $ setup.bat
(book_exp_1) $ jupyter notebook
```

The environment settings allow you to add custom configuration for Jupyter or Ipython in your experiment directory.  For example, any library code you are developing can be added in the local `.ipython` directory to automatically be included in the path of your kernels.

[^2]: Moreover, it is not uncommon for buy orders to be placed from non-public player-owned structures.  This is mostly a nuisance for processing market data.
[^3]: Some financial markets have "dark pools" which are off exchange markets, usually reserved for specific types of transactions.  Dark pools do not always guarantee anonymity.
[^4]: Arbitrage and market-making strategies are well suited to automated trading (i.e. "botting").  However, this is explicitly forbidden by the EULA.
[^5]: CCP has an interesting view on the legality of these efforts.  The End User License Agreement (EULA) explicitly forbids cache scraping.  However, CCP has consistently said that they enforce the EULA at their discretion and, practically speaking, they have tolerated scraping market data for many years.  More recently, CCP has said many of their new third party APIs are intended to eliminate the need for cache scraping.  The new market data APIs are a direct result of such efforts.
[^6]: The size of the window for this average, and whether the average is over all regions is not documented anywhere.
[^7]: Whereas iPython mainly supports the Python language, the Jupyter project is more inclusive and intends to provide support for numerous "data science" languages including [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [Julia](http://julialang.org/).  At time of writing, however, Python is still the best supported language in Jupyter.
