    "### Example 14 - Selecting Market Making Targets\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we'll filter for good market making targets according to the following criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Liquidity** - the extent to which assets can be bought or sold at stable prices \\(typically reflected by volume\\).\n",
    "2. **Profitable Spread Ratio** - whether the spread ratio \\(ask / bid\\) is usually profitable for an asset.\n",
    "3. **Return** - the return on the funds we use for market making.\n",
    "4. **Balanced Volume** - we'll only consider assets with reasonable volume on both sides of the book.\n",
    "5. **Competition** - we'll limit ourselves to assets without too much competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed in the text, we'll restrict our analysis to one day of the week \\(Saturday\\) over several months of history.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we've already developed all of the tools we need to perform our analysis from previous chapters. This example, therefore, largely consists of choosing thresholds for existing tools."
