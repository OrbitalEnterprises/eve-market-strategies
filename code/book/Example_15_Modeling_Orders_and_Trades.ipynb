    "### Example 15 - Modeling Orders and Trades\n",
    "\n",
    "As described in the text, our market making simulation relies on random order and trade generators.  The extent to which our simulator emulates realistic trading depends on how well our random event generators reflect actual market behavior.  We'll build our generators based on statistical properties of historical orders and trades.  From historical order book snapshots, we can model the arrival rate, side, size and price of orders as they arrive.  Likewise, we can infer or estimate trades \\(as described in Example 4\\) to model arrival rate, side and size of trades.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As described in the text, we'll need to create four event generators:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **New Order**: an event with properties: arrival offset, side, duration, volume, minimum volume, \"top of book\", and price offset.\n",
    "2. **Change Order**: an event with properites: arrival offset, and side.\n",
    "3. **Cancel Order**: an event with properties: arrival offset, and side.\n",
    "4. **Trade**: an event with properties: arrival offset, side, and volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, our generators will be constructed for a single asset type using a single day of historic data.  A more realistic simulation would, of course, construct generators for all assets being traded over multiple days of historic data."

We'll start with the first snapshot of the day as a given and track all changes after that.  For this example, we're only considering a single day of history.  In reality, we'll need to extract historic observations over multiple days and build our trade observations from that combined data.  Note that we don't bother recording price information for orders or trades as this is likely to change day to day and is not relevant for our simulation needs.  We do, however, extract a reference price and spread from the first order book snapshot.  These values are used to help prime simulated books with reasonable starting values."

    "How can we model the distribution of trade volume for our simulation?  Normally, we would attempt to match the shape of our distribution to a well known statistical distribution.  However, we don't have enough data to make that possible in this example.  Also, market data at this granularity \\(i.e. very fine\\) is notoriously difficult to map to simple distributions.  To work around this problem, we'll instead resort to a rough approximation using a distribution based on the cumulative distribution function \\(CDF\\) inferred from the raw sample data.  We can create a CDF using a histogram with cumulative sums across the buckets.  Taking the inverse of this CDF gives a function we can randomly sample to generate values from the \n",

There's one catch with interarrival times, however, which is that they will all be on five minute boundaries because we assign the trade time based on snapshot time.  This would make simulated interarrival time unrealistic and also easy to game in a strategy.  Therefore, we'll skew interarrival times by adding a uniformly distributed value between 0 and 300 seconds to each sample.  This will simulate a trade arriving sometime in the interval between two snapshots.  With that one small change, we're now ready to create our trade interarrival time generator in the next cell."
